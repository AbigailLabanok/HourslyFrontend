# Description
This is the frontend repository for Hoursly, an app designed to help students quickly find and track TA office hours across all their currently enrolled courses.

## Midpoint Submission Notes:
- The plan is to have 4 fully functional screens (technically 3 since the first one is more of an aesthetically pleasing screen)
- Navigation exists between all of the screens --> you can go between screens using the footer + using the different buttons on the screen
- There are more than 3 testable @Preview composables
- There is a TeacherViewModel for some core functionality, such as the favoriting system, but most of the core functionality is reliant on the backend, so waiting for that first
- The HomeScreen is basically fully completed --> the only things left are the getAllItems and searchItems functions, which will be made using the backend api
